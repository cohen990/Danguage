want to have all objects inherit from a base object class

all objects have a collection of functions and operators

operators follow object
functions are dotted after objects (c-like language)? or should the look like operators?

system print "hello my name is Dan"
or system.print("hello my name is Dan")

since it's newline delimited, the first could work.
